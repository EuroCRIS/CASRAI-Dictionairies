# euroCRIS preserves the CASRAI Dictionaries

[CASRAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortia_Advancing_Standards_in_Research_Administration_Information) 
(Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information) had developed valueable assets.

[euroCRIS](https://eurocris.org) has agreed to preserve a part of these assets (see the [announcement on the euroCRIS website](https://eurocris.org/news/casrai-domain-handover)).
These are made available here.
Other CASRAI assets are preserved by [CODATA](https://codata.org/) (the [Research Data Management](https://codata.org/initiatives/data-science-and-stewardship/rdm-terminology-wg/) terminology) and [NISO](http://niso.org/) (the [CRediT](http://credit.niso.org/) taxonomy of contributor roles).
