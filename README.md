# euroCRIS preserves the  of the CASRAI Dictionaries

[CASRAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortia_Advancing_Standards_in_Research_Administration_Information) 
(Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information) had developed valueable assets.

euroCRIS has agreed to preserve a part of these assets (see the [announcement on the euroCRIS website](https://eurocris.org/news/casrai-domain-handover)).
These are made available here.
Other CASRAI assets are preserved by [CODATA](https://codata.org/initiatives/data-science-and-stewardship/rdm-terminology-wg/) and [NISO](http://credit.niso.org/).
