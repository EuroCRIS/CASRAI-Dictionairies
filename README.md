# The CASRAI Open Access Glossary and Templates

[CASRAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortia_Advancing_Standards_in_Research_Administration_Information)
(Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information) had developed valueable assets.
[euroCRIS](https://eurocris.org) has agreed to preserve a part of these assets (see the [announcement on the euroCRIS website](https://eurocris.org/news/casrai-domain-handover) or the [archived CASRAI frontpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20220624175507/https://casrai.org/)).
These are made available here.

Other CASRAI assets are preserved by [CODATA](https://codata.org/) (the [Research Data Management](https://codata.org/initiatives/data-science-and-stewardship/rdm-terminology-wg/) terminology) and [NISO](http://niso.org/) (the [CRediT](http://credit.niso.org/) taxonomy of contributor roles).

### The CASRAI information model

CASRAI, through its unique working group centered process, constructed a model for some business documents in the domain of research:
* [Abridged Academic CV](./Templates/CV%20-%20Abridged%20Academic.md)
* [Full Academic CV](./Templates/CV%20-%20Full%20Academic.md)
* [DMP Ethics Review](./Templates/DMP%20Ethics%20Review.md)
* [Open Access APC Report](./Templates/Open%20Access%20APC%20Report.md)

These are the top-level ones that were defined.
The two CVs share a total of 19 sections and subsections, which are also listed under [Templates](./Templates/).

The Templates use 123 [Objects](./Objects/) as basic building blocks.
These objects have 1,035 ([Object fields](./Object-Fields)) properties in total.
Some of these properties may use controlled vocabularies, the 10 [Picklists](./Picklists/).
